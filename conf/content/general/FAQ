    "question": "What is SmarterPool?",
    "answer": "SmarterPool is a an online platform that connects students with companies through real world challenges.
               This solution was created as a result of the high student unemployment and lack of corporate innovation happening
               in India.  By posting challenges, companies identify students based on skills, and use a larger, smarter pool, to
               collaborate on innovative solutions."

 },
 {
    "question": "What happens to students who do not succeed in attaining a reward?",
    "answer": "Since there is an employment, reward or recognition opportunity, we believe students will work hard on each challenge.
               Those that do not succeed therefore, will have contributed excellent work that was not specific to the company they
               applied to, but not of poor overall quality.  This work is added to the portfolio, carefully reviewed by the
               SmarterPool team, and feedback is given.  SmarterPool is also connected to various mentors and experts, who can help
               students along the way."
