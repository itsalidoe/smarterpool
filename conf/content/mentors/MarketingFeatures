                solution was created as a result of the high student/graduate unemployment and lack of corporate innovation
                happening in India. By posting challenges, companies identify students based on skills, and use a larger,
                smarter pool, to collaborate on innovative solutions. Students find challenges that resonate with their
                interests and studies, and earn temporary income for their work.",
